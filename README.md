# README

Small repo for my multithreaded projects from uni. Mainly for GoLang i guess.

1. Project
	I program - wrong calculation of an integral using goroutines (without any control over access to the main variable)
	II program - calculation of an integral using goroutines and mutexes
	III program - calculation of an integral using goroutines and critical section (and mutexes)
	IV program - calculation of an integral using a different method than those mentioned above. Right now it's just by using channels.
